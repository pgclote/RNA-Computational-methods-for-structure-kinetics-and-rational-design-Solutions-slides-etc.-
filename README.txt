If you use any of my programs for your research, please cite my work; apart from that I hope that this material helps you in your studies and research.

Directions for optimal use:
===========================
1) Download all the .tgz files as well as the index.html file into a single, dedicated directory named "RNAbook" or with similar name.
2) Go into the book directory
   "cd RNAbook"
3) Extract the .tgz files:
   "tar -xzf filename.tgz"
where "filename.tgz" is replaced by "CHAP1.tgz",...,"CHAP10.tgz", "SLIDES.tgz", and "PROGRAMS.tgz".
4) Ensure that the file "index.html" is located in the directory "RNAbook".
5) Open "index.html" with your browser to access the slides, programs and exercise solutions in an easy and clear manner.
